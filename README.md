# Handlers in action in Ott

This is a formalisation of the core Î»eff calculus from the *Handlers in action*
preprint by Kammar, Lindley and Oury.  At present it only contains the
operational semantics.  The definition is written in
[Ott](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/) and the `Makefile` produces Coq and
Isabelle/HOL definitions.  There are some example terms in the `HandlersEx.*`
files, and some code to execute them in `HandlersResults.*`.

The libraries and preprint for the actual paper can be found at
[https://github.com/slindley/effect-handlers].
